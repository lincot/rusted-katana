# rusted katana

fast solutions to all [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) katas written in Rust

## why?

it's not enough to solve a problem, it needs to be solved well

## general rules

- nontrivial katas have benchmarks to easily compare solutions

- solutions are safe, meaning that they will panic or return nonsense
on nonsense input rather than causing undefined behavior

- even though Codewars tests contain only ASCII input,
they use Rust's standard UTF-8â€“encoded strings,
so solutions for string katas are made for Unicode input

- proposed function signatures and argument names are preserved;
however, needed items always have `pub` keyword added to them and,
where possible, functions are marked as `const`

- usage of third-party crates is allowed even if not accepted by Codewars
(never used though)

- lookup tables aren't generally allowed
